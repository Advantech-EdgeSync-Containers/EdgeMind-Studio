# Container Overview

After the container is launched, it will start the **EdgeMind Studio** application based on the **Jetson** or **Atlas** platform, providing the following core functionalities:

**1. Video Management Features**
- **Multi-source Video Management:** Supports local cameras, IP network cameras, and uploaded MP4 video files.

- **NVR (Network Video Recorder):** Records and enables playback of connected camera feeds.

**2. Video AI Analysis & Performance Monitoring**
- **Model Management:** Provides AI model deployment and management for flexible and convenient scalability.

- **AI Intelligent Analysis:** Real-time object detection based on the YOLO model for camera feeds or MP4 videos, with alert notification support.

- **Video AI Region Detection (ROI Analysis):** Allows defining key detection regions (ROI) in the video frame, focusing AI analysis only on specified areas to reduce computational load.

- **Performance Monitoring:** Displays real-time AI processing metrics, including video frame rate, model failure rate, and CPU/GPU resource usage.

- **Multi-screen Live Viewing:** Supports simultaneous display of multiple video streams for real-time monitoring.
